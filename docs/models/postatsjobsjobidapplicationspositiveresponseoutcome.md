# PostAtsJobsJobIdApplicationsPositiveResponseOutcome

Parsed status of the application. If Kombo identifies that the application was accepted and the candidate hired, it will be `HIRED`. If the application was rejected or the candidate declined, it will be `DECLINED`. If the application is still in process, it will be `PENDING`.
Kombo will always try to deliver this information as reliably as possible.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { PostAtsJobsJobIdApplicationsPositiveResponseOutcome } from "@kombo-api/sdk/models";

let value: PostAtsJobsJobIdApplicationsPositiveResponseOutcome = "PENDING";
```

## Values

```typescript
"PENDING" | "HIRED" | "DECLINED"
```
